# OS & Version Detection Module - TraceNet

## Overview

This module of TraceNet focuses on identifying the Operating System (OS) and its version running on a target machine. It employs two core techniques for fingerprinting:

1. Active Fingerprinting  
   Sends crafted packets to the target and analyzes the responses to deduce OS information.

2. Passive Fingerprinting  
   Observes network traffic without interacting directly with the target, inferring OS details based on packet characteristics.

## Features

- Uses Active and Passive Fingerprinting techniques for comprehensive OS detection.
- Implements multithreading to speed up scanning by running parallel detection tasks.
- Command-line interface built with argparse for flexible and user-friendly input handling.
- Colored terminal output provided by colorama for clear, visually appealing status and result messages.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: colorama, argparse, scapy, threading (built-in)

You can install required external libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Run the module from the command line, specifying the target IP or domain and optional arguments to control scanning behavior.

Example:
      python os_version_detection.py --target 192.168.1.1 --active

MODULE STRUCTURE

  .os_version_detection.py - Main script that handles command-line input, initializes threads, and manages scanning.

  .fingerprinting/active.py - Implements active fingerprinting logic.

  .fingerprinting/passive.py - Implements passive fingerprinting logic.



Contribution
Feel free to contribute improvements or additional fingerprinting techniques to enhance TraceNetâ€™s OS detection capabilities.

# TraceNet - Banner Grabbing Module

## Overview

This module is part of the TraceNet VAPT Tool project. It performs **banner grabbing** to identify services running on target systems through multiple techniques and supports evasion methods to bypass detection.

---

## Banner Grabbing Techniques

### Core Techniques
1. **TCP Socket Banner Grabbing**  
   Directly connects to the target's TCP port and reads the banner.

2. **HTTP/HTTPS Banner Grabbing**  
   Sends HTTP/HTTPS requests and captures server response headers.

### Evasion Techniques
1. **Fragmentation**  
   Sends the packets in small fragmented parts to evade simple packet inspection.

2. **Proxy and VPN Usage**  
   Routes banner grabbing requests through proxies (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP) or VPNs to mask the origin IP.

## Command-Line Inputs

| Argument     | Short | Description                             | Required | Type          | Choices                   |
|--------------|-------|-------------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| `--target`   | `-t`  | Target IP address or domain           | Yes      | String        | â€”                         |
| `--port`     | `-p`  | Target port number                    | Yes      | Integer       | â€”                         |
| `--proxy_ip` | `-x`  | Proxy IP address                      | Yes      | String        | â€”                         |
| `--proxy_port`| `-q` | Proxy port number                     | Yes      | Integer       | â€”                         |
| `--proxy_type`| `-y`  | Proxy type                           | Yes      | String        | socks4, socks5, http      |

## Installation Requirements

Before running, make sure to install required Python packages:

```bash

. colorama â€” For colored terminal output
. argparse â€” For command-line argument parsing (built-in but listed for clarity)
. PySocks â€” For SOCKS proxy support
. requests â€” For HTTP/HTTPS requests

Usage Example
    
      python proxy_banner_grabber.py -t 192.168.1.10 -p 80 -x 127.0.0.1 -q 1080 -y socks5

This command runs the banner grabber against target 192.168.1.10 on port 80 using a SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1:1080


How It Works

. Connects to the target port via specified proxy
. Attempts to grab the banner using the selected method
. Applies evasion techniques if specified (e.g., fragmented packets, proxy chaining)
. Outputs the service banner or error message if connection fails
